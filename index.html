        <h2 id="Hawaii">Hawaii</h2>
            <img src="Images/Hawaii.jpg" alt="Picture of Hawaii">
            <p>From the hustle and bustle of Oahu to the romance of Maui
            and off-the-beaten-path pursuits on Lanai and Molokai, the 
            Hawaiian Islands offer enough to see, do and feel to fill a 
            lifetime’s worth of dreams. So where do you begin? Hawaii’s 
            spectacular beaches and lush valleys offer endless outdoor 
            experiences, including surfing, hiking, skydiving, helicopter 
            tours, paddle sports, whale-watching and zip lining. You can 
            also swim with manta rays at night, float down tunnels on old 
            sugar plantations and walk a lunar landscape at Garden of the 
            Gods. Choose your adventure and let the memories begin.</p>
            
            <p>Hawaii is home to five active volcanoes. Four are located 
            on Hawaii Island: Kīlauea, Maunaloa, Hualālai and Maunakea. 
            The fifth, Haleakalā, is located on Maui. The most popular 
            place to see volcanoes in Hawaii is Hawaii Volcanoes National 
            Park, home to two active volcanoes: Kilauea and Maunaloa. There
            is currently no lava flow in the park, but depending on conditions, 
            you may be able to see steam. Visitors are required to stay on 
            designated trails and should not approach lava. Check weather and 
            volcano conditions before visiting Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>

            <p>Marvel at colorful canyons, valleys and waterfalls while hiking 
            the 35.5-kilometer Napali Coast. Crystal-clear, turquoise waters 
            invite snorkeling in the Molokini Crater off the coast of Maui. Take 
            a surfing lesson to ride the waves at popular Waikiki Beach or trek 
            to the less-traveled island of Lanai to visit the Kaunolu Village Site, 
            a prehistoric Hawaiian fishing village. On Kauai, try waterfall rappelling, 
            tubing through old sugar plantation chutes or kayaking the serene Wailua 
            River amid ancient mountains and rainforests. Off the Kohala Coast of 
            Hawaii, December through April, take a whale-watching cruise at sunset and 
            listen to whale songs on an underwater hydrophone.</p>

        <h2 id="Paris">Paris</h2>  
            <img src="Images/Paris.jpg" alt="Picture of Paris">  
            <p>Lingering over pain au chocolat in a sidewalk café, relaxing after a 
            day of strolling along the Seine and marveling at icons like the Eiffel 
            Tower and the Arc de Triomphe… the perfect Paris experience combines leisure 
            and liveliness with enough time to savor both an exquisite meal and exhibits 
            at the Louvre. Awaken your spirit at Notre Dame, bargain hunt at the Marché 
            aux Puces de Montreuil or for goodies at the Marché Biologique Raspail, then 
            cap it all off with a risqué show at the Moulin Rouge.</p>

            <p>People from all over the world are drawn to its cutting-edge fashion, 
            art, and culinary scenes, as well as a certain je ne sais quoi that appeals 
            to all kinds. While the attractions are plentiful on any Paris trip, this is 
            an insider's city, steeped in a rich history of riots and revolutions. Every 
            quarter is unique and, though the summer is the most popular season to visit, 
            each time of year is compelling in its own way.</p>

            <p>From the hilly cobblestoned streets of Montmartre with its rich history of 
            Belle Époque artists and cabarets, to the quickly gentrifying neighborhood of 
            Belleville, arts and culture are steeped in the city’s DNA. Parisians sometimes 
            joke that they visit museums as often as they go to the bathroom, and to truly 
            understand Paris you have to immerse yourself in the city’s artistic culture. 
            Beyond the Louvre and the Musée d’Orsay, you can get your culture fix at the 
            renovated Picasso Museum and the new Fondation Louis Vuitton, not to mention 
            dozens of small museums and galleries.</p>

        <h2 id="Venice">Venice</h2>   
            <img src="Images/Venice.jpg" alt="Picture of Venice"> 
            <p>The romantic city of Venice is located in the Veneto region of Italy — one 
            of the northernmost states. This ancient and historically important city was 
            originally built on 100 small islands in the Adriatic Sea. Instead or roads, 
            Venice relies on a series of waterways and canals.</p>

            <p>One of the most famous areas of the city is the world-renowned Grand Canal 
            thoroughfare, which was a major centre of the Renaissance. Another unmistakable 
            area is the central square in Venice, called the Piazza San Marco. This is where 
            you’ll find a range of Byzantine mosaics, the Campanile bell and, of course, 
            the stunning St. Mark’s Basilica.</p>
